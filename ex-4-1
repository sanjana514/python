# Write a python program to translate a message into secret code language. Use the rules below to translate normal English into secret code language

# Coding:
# if the word contains atleast 3 characters, remove the first letter and append it at the end
#   now append three random characters at the starting and the end
# else:
#   simply reverse the string

# Decoding:
# if the word contains less than 3 characters, reverse it
# else:
#   remove 3 random characters from start and end. Now remove the last letter and append it to the beginning
# Your program should ask whether you want to code or decode
'''This is the simple basic code for this problem without using split ..it is just a simple coding and decoding of a long string not word by word coding/decoding.For word by word coding/decoding we need to do split so see ex-4_2'''
a=input('enter your msg:')
choice=input("1 for coding and 2 for decoding: ")
coding=True if (choice=="1") else False
print(a)
print(coding)
if(coding):
  if(len(a)>=3):
    s1='abc'
    s2='fng'
    an=s1+a[1:]+a[0]+s2
    print(an)
  else:
    print(a[::-1])
